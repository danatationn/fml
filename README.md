# fml (fuck mouselook)
this is a little add-on for gzdoom made for people that play with mouselook off

this add-on solves the problem of you firing a cool weapon, and it launching your head backwards, not moving it back in the process
<br/>
it also solves the problem of annoying mod authors turning off autoaim for weapons

### cvars
* `fml_enabled` default: true - enables the mod
* `fml_force_autoaim` default: false - tries to bring back autoaim for all weapons. (some weapons actually work best without autoaim, so only use this when necessary)
* `fml_pitch_max` default: 8.0 - caps your view. useful for making machine guns not break your neck or to force your view to always be centered
