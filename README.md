# fml (fuck mouselook)
this is a little add-on for gzdoom made for people that play with mouselook off

this add-on solves the problem of you firing a cool weapon, and it launching your head backwards, not moving it back in the process

### cvars
* `fml_enabled` default: true - enables the mod
* `fml_during_shooting` default: false - it resets your pitch even when you're shooting/your gun isn't ready. this is more aggresive in terms of pitch correction
